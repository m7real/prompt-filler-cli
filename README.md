# Prompt Filler CLI (Under Development)

**Note:** This project is still under development and is not the final version. We are actively working on improving and adding more features.

## Overview

Prompt Filler CLI is a command-line interface tool written in Go that helps users fill out templates with placeholders efficiently. The tool scans a given text template for placeholders, prompts the user for input, and substitutes the placeholders with the provided values.

## Features

- Identifies placeholders within a text template.
- Interactive command-line interface for user input.
- Validates user input to ensure fields are not left empty.
- Outputs the completed text with all placeholders filled.

## Installation

- This will be updated later, please stay tuned.

## Usage

## Example

Given a template like this:

```
[Your Name]
[Your Email Address]

Dear [Recipient's Name],

I am interested in the [Position] position at [Company Name].
```

The CLI will prompt you for each placeholder, and upon completion, output the filled version.
